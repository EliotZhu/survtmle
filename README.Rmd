> Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE) for Survival Analysis with
> Competing Risks

__Authors:__ [David Benkeser](https://www.benkeserstatistics.com/) and [Nima
Hejazi](http://nimahejazi.org)

## Description

`survtmle` is an R package designed to use targeted minimum loss-based
estimation (TMLE) to compute covariate-adjusted marginal cumulative incidence 
estimates in right-censored survival settings with and without competing risks. 
The estimates can leverage ensemble machine learning via the `SuperLearner`
package.

---

## Installation

You can install a stable release of `survtmle` from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("benkeser/survtmle")
```

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (an initial release will be coming soon) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("survtmle")
```

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have any specific feature requests, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/benkeser/survtmle/issues).

## Example

This minimal example shows how to use `survtmle` to obtain cumulative incidence
estimates with a very simple, simulated data set.

```{r example, fig.align='center'}
library(survtmle)
set.seed(341796)

# simulate data
n <- 100
t_0 <- 10
W <- data.frame(W1 = runif(n), W2 = rbinom(n, 1, 0.5))
A <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
T <- rgeom(n,plogis(-4 + W$W1 * W$W2 - A)) + 1
C <- rgeom(n, plogis(-6 + W$W1)) + 1
ftime <- pmin(T, C)
ftype <- as.numeric(ftime == T)

# apply survtmle for estimation
fit <- survtmle(ftime = ftime, ftype = ftype,
                trt = A, adjustVars = W,
                glm.ftime = "I(W1*W2) + trt + t",
                glm.ctime = "W1 + t", method = "hazard",
                verbose = TRUE,  t0 = t_0, maxIter = 2)

# extract cumulative incidence at each time point
tpfit <- timepoints(fit, times = seq_len(t_0))

# examine output object produced by the timepoints function
print(tpfit)

# examine plot of cumulative incidences
plot(tpfit)
```
